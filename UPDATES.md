## Code Fixes Applied

### Backend Package Structure
Created `backend/__init__.py` to make the backend directory a proper Python package, solving the "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" error.

**File Created:**
```python
# backend/__init__.py
"""Options Pricing Backend Package"""
```

### Import Handling in analyzer.py
Updated `backend/utils/analyzer.py` to handle both relative and absolute imports gracefully:

```python
try:
    # Try relative import (when used as a package)
    from ..models import BlackScholesModel, BinomialTreeModel, MonteCarloModel
except (ImportError, ValueError):
    # Fall back to direct import (when backend is in sys.path)
    from models import BlackScholesModel, BinomialTreeModel, MonteCarloModel
```

This ensures the code works in both scenarios:
1. When run as a proper Python package
2. When backend is added to `sys.path` (as done in Flask app)
